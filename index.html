              <p>
                Within the things I enjoy doing, there are some I have picked up
                very recently. Fencing is a new hobbi! I was introduced to it by
                a friend and so far it has been very exciting. Specially when I
                battle my friend or the instructor.

                Most of the time I get struk in the foot. I can't be that
                precise to get points by striking the foot, the arm or even the
                head... And as far as I understand, you are allowed to stabb
                people in the head... We wear masks, so it is not like I am
                gonna inflict a fatal wound on anyone anyway.

                I like videogames. I have played many over the years, but some
                of my favourites are RPG, the ones that involve a lot of
                exploring... although after so much exploration, I lose track of
                the plot line

            <section class="anime">
              <p>
                Back when I was 15 years old, my sister introduced me to anime.
                Now, watching anime has become a regular activity. I also read
                manga, and I have collected a couple of volumes of Demon Slayer,
                Koe no Katachi and Nichijou. At some point I even tried to learn
                Japanese! but it didn't quite work out.

              <p>
                I am from a little tiny country in central america called El
                Salvador. Although being tiny, it has beautiful landscape. The
                seaside is always warm and you get to enjoy not only of the
                salty and fresh sea, but also of nice food!

                I am studying at Northcoders. It has been just my first week and
                things got a bit scary with regex, but I like it a lot. It is
                not that different from when I started learning how to make
                websites back in 2021. Back then it was just a way entertain
                myself, but time have changed. I need to do my best so that I
                can learn as much as possible and get a job as a web developer!
                I am still figuring out whether I want to work front or back
                end, but I guess once we get to learn about servers I will find
                out.
